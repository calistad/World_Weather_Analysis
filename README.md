# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

We will apply analysis, visualizations, and statistical skill to retrieve weather and map data from several websites through an API.

## Summary

First, we will add the weather description to the weather data and use input statements to filter the data for the weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 

Then, from the list of potential travel destinations, we will create a travel itinerary by choosing four cities: 
- Merrill
- Jamestown
- Cedar City 
- Blue Springs

Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, we will create a travel route between the cities, as well as a marker layer map.
